The DoE also strives to achieve equal employment opportunity in all personnel operations through continuing diversity enhancement programs. 
Prohibited Practices 
The DOE has a zero-tolerance Policy for Prohibited Practices, which means: 
·         The DOE will review 100% of any complaints received for these practices 
·         The complaint will then be submitted to an external independent contractor for further investigation 
·         The DOE shall report all prohibited practice complaints to the GCF 
·         If the investigator finds that there is a breach of the Prohibited Practice Policy by the contractor, the contract will be terminated 
These Prohibited Practices include:   
·         Abuse; 
·         ""Coercion"" or Coercive practice; 
·         ""Collusion"" or Collusive practice;

Or to the DOE complaint mechanism at:     
https://www.environment.gov.ag/contact 
Your complaint and its information will be sent to the Integrity Commission and then processed at the DOE. Complainants can be kept confidential, but the accusations will be communicated to the relevant persons. Before any actions are taken, the DOE will assess the accuracy of the information provided. Complainants must note that there is a penalty under the laws of Antigua and Barbuda for providing false information. Noted further that once the investigation is completed the DOE is legally obligated with a duty to report to the GCF. 
Background Checks Information
The DOE is, therefore, asking that all applicants who are shortlisted be prepared to provide information to allow the DOE to better communicate to our partners at the Green Climate Fund, our contractors and service providers.  Information needed includes, but is not limited to, company registration, police record, certificate of good standing with the Inland Revenue Department, registration numbers for Social Security, Medical Benefit Scheme, and Board of Education.  Applicants are encouraged to be in good standing with these organizations.  Please note that if the police record indicates that the individual/company has violated any laws this does not necessarily disqualify the individual/company from winning the bid.   Where references are requested at least one of these must come from an immediate past client/employer.   In addition to this, the contract will be subject to further background check if required.  If this is required, the successful individual/company will be notified accordingly.
